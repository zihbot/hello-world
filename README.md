My first repostory, to learn how GitHub works

I'm a Hungarian student, who wants to practice programming and for this, the best place obviously the GitHub. But first, I have to learn how it works, so I'm just typing here something, to make a change in this file. It will be just a simple Hello, World! project, an easy thing to begin with.
